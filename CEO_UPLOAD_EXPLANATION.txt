The upload system is flexible - only Symbol/Ticker is required, all other fields are optional. If you upload 1 field or 5 fields, it processes what you provide and sets missing fields to null (they won't overwrite existing data). The system automatically detects column headers, so you can use different layouts as long as column names are recognizable (e.g., "Symbol" or "Ticker", "Pay Day" or "Payment Frequency"). There's no need for multiple layouts - one flexible system handles variations.

The "Div" column is completely optional. If included, it updates only the dividend amount for the most recent dividend while preserving all Tiingo data (dates, split adjustments, etc.). If Tiingo doesn't have the latest dividend yet, include the Div column with the amount - the system updates the most recent existing dividend, and when Tiingo syncs later (usually 2-3 days), it automatically matches and replaces your entry with official Tiingo data seamlessly. This lets you show the latest dividend immediately without breaking anything or creating duplicates.
