# Draft Message to CEO

---

Hi [CEO Name],

I had Gemini check the file I gave you for the 5-year z-score calculation, and it identified that we had 6 years of data instead of 5. I've attached the corrected file on GAB for your review.

Please review and let me know your thoughts on the calculation logic and formulas. Once we agree that the logic and formulas are correct, we can proceed with switching to the 3-year z-score as we discussed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Alternative (More Detailed Version)

Hi [CEO Name],

I wanted to follow up on the z-score calculation we discussed. I had Gemini review the file I provided earlier for the 5-year z-score, and it flagged that we were using 6 years of data instead of 5. 

I've now corrected this and have attached an updated file showing the GAB calculation with the proper 5-year window. The formula and methodology remain the same:
- Premium/Discount: (Price / NAV - 1) × 100
- Average: Mean of all P/D values in the 5-year period
- STDEV.P: Population standard deviation
- Z-Score: (Current P/D - Average) / STDEV.P

I know we discussed moving to a 3-year z-score, but I wanted to confirm the logic and formulas are correct with this 5-year example first. Once you've reviewed and we're aligned on the approach, I can implement the 3-year z-score calculation using the same methodology.

Please let me know your thoughts when you have a chance to review.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
