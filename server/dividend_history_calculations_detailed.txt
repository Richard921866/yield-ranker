Step 2: Sort by date (newest first), with manual entries prioritized
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorting Logic: Manual entries first, then by date (newest first)
Sorted Order (showing first 5 and last 5):
  1. 2025-12-11: $0.1125 
  2. 2025-11-14: $0.1125 
  3. 2025-10-14: $0.1125

  304. 2002-03-13: $0.1062 
  305. 2002-02-13: $0.1062 

Step 3: Reverse to chronological order (oldest first)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chronological Order (Oldest First) - Amount Used for Comparison:
  1. 2002-02-13: $0.1062 (using adj_amount)
  2. 2002-03-13: $0.1062 (using adj_amount)

  302. 2025-09-12: $0.1125 (using adj_amount)
  303. 2025-10-14: $0.1125 (using adj_amount)
  304. 2025-11-14: $0.1125 (using adj_amount)
  305. 2025-12-11: $0.1125 (using adj_amount)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

  150. 2025-12-22: $0.2621 (using adj_amount)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

  138. 2025-12-09: $0.1550 (using adj_amount)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 2: Sort by date (newest first), with manual entries prioritized
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorting Logic: Manual entries first, then by date (newest first)
Sorted Order (showing first 5 and last 5):

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)

Step 4: Compare each dividend to previous one using formula:
  currentAmount = current.adj_amount ?? current.div_cash
  previousAmount = previous.adj_amount ?? previous.div_cash
  if (currentAmount > previousAmount) → INCREASE (+)
  if (currentAmount < previousAmount) → DECREASE (-)
